    "## Intro to Databases\n",
    "* What are databases?\n",
    "  * Collection of information/data that has an interface for interacting with the data\n",
    "  * Simply said, databases are a method of achieving data persistence.\n",
    "    * For example: \n",
    "        * info stored in a db will continue to exist if the server is turned off, restarted,  internet connection is lost, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Example\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users\n",
    "INSERT something into DB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB example\n",
    "```mongoose\n",

    "## SQL vs NoSQL:  Two Households, Both Alike In Dignity\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL (Relational Database Management System)\n",
    "  * Databases are tabular and flat.\n",
    "  * Every single row must follow the same pre-defined pattern.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Example: Pairing users with comments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### USERS TABLE <br>\n",
    "\n",

    " --- | ---- | --- | ----\n",

    " 3   | Sue  | 40  | Boulder \n",
    "  \n",
    " * Every  user has an id, name, age, city\n",
    " * If a new attrubute is added to one user, it must be propogated to all users in the database.\n",
    "   * Inflexible, have to define exact patterns ahead of time and stick close to them.\n",

    "## CRUD COMMANDS\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Create: Inserting Item Into a Collection**  \n",
    "  * `insert()`\n",
    "    * inserts into a collection. A collection is usually referred to as \"a database of\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * example: \n",
    "      * `db.dogs.insert({name: \"Rusty\", breed: \"Mutt\"})`\n",
    "        * creates a dogs collection (we are making a database of dogs).\n",
    "        * a new dog whose name is Rusty and whose breed is Mutt is inserted into the collection/db.\n",
    "        * if successful, \"WriteResult({ \"nInserted\" : 1 })\" will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Read: Finding Information from (Querying) the Database** \n",
    "* `find()`\n",
    "  * returns objects that match the query passed in.<br>\n",

    "    * **OVERWRITES** the object representing Rusty, and inserts the newly specified data passed in.\n",
    "      * So in this example, \"Rusty\" is now known as \"Tater\". \n",
    "      * NOTE: I say \"now known as\", because that particular object still has the same object ID.<br><br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "  * example: `db.dogs.update({name: \"Rusty\", breed: \"Mutt\"}, {$set: {name: \"Tater\", isCute: true }})`\n",
    "    * **TRUE UPDATE**, **changing** Rusty's name field to \"Tater\", **adding** an isCute property, while **preserving** all other properties of the object representing (the dog formerly known as) Rusty.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Delete: Removing Item from the Database**\n",
    "* `remove()`\n",
    "  * returns `WriteResult({ \"nRemoved\" : # })` detailing how many Objects were deleted\n",
    "  * by default, removes all Objects matching a query.\n",
    "  * example: `db.dogs.remove({breed: \"Mutt\"})`\n",
    "    * if there were multiple dogs in our db that had a breed of Mutt, they'd all be destroyed/removed from the db.\n",
