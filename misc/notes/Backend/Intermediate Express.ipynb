    "template: Dynamic HTML file\n",
    "\n",
    "### EJS: Embedded JavaScript\n",
    "> Allows us to write a normal HTML file, and embed some JS {vars, conditionals, loops, etc} in there to dynamically render on page load.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax for ejs (in .ejs file):\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "<h1>You fell in love with: <%=thingVar %></h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Express expects all `.ejs` files to be in a folder called `ProjectDirectoryName/views`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering Dynamic HTML (templates)\n",
    "> Use `res.render()` to render HTML (from an EJS file).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: renders the home.ejs file (which is really just a fancy HTML file ;))\n",
    "```javascript\n",

    "  res.render(\"home.ejs\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing  variables to EJS templates.\n",
    "> When passing vars to an EJS file, use `res.render(\"love.ejs\", {});`. Note the second param for `res.render()` is an object. It will essentially be a mapping in the style of `(varInEjs <- varInExpress)`, just proper syntax is ``{varInEjs:varInExpress}``\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// thing is a route param, denoted with a colon\n",
    "app.get(\"/fallinlovewith/:thing\", function(req, res) {\n",
    "  // retrieve the \"thing\" from req(uest)'s list of params.\n",
    "  var thing = req.params.thing;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // render the love.ejs file\n",
    "  //  in that file:\n",
    "        <%=thingVar %> expects thing.\n",
    "  // SO bezicly, thingVar in that file is waiting to \"receive\" var thing in this file.                                         \n",

    "    * **NOTE:** a node_modules folder will probably be added, this is OK.\n",

    "## EJS Control Flow\n",
    "> So basically, to write control flow {if, for, while, else, etc} in ejs files, just write the plain HTML, write the regular JS, surround **each line** of the pure JS with `<% *logic goes here* %>` around each line that is solely JS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: Why is `<% %>` being used here instead of `<%= %>`?\n",
    "* Answer: \n",
    "  * `<%= %>` takes the value returned by the JS code, and prints it to the HTML,\n",
