    "### Why Sessions?\n",
    "  * HTTP is supposed to be \"stateless\" protocal\n",
    "    * Sending requests that are one-time, don't contain info about history\n",
    "    * Not linked together\n",
    "    * Doesn't have a state.\n",
    "      \n",
    "* However, this is counterproductive to our goals, specifically:\n",
    "    * stealing user da--- I mean, preserving user data\n",
    "    * Letting server know that user is still logged in\n",
    "    * Provide user authentication\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * How can we add states to HTTP so we can implement user auth?\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Our Answer? Sessions.** [And then the whole server clapped.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/and-then-the-whole-bus-clapped) \n",
    "  * Express Session\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication Flow\n",
    "1. Request made to server by client (user).\n",
    "2. Some information about user (that made the request) is saved in the request.\n",
    "3. Information is encoded, and request is sent.\n",
    "4. Server receives request.\n",
    "5. Passport decodes request and reads request to see if user is logged in."
