Quick recap of 8/28 after class standup:

# Deployment
 * We are now deployed on heroku and mlab [here](https://team7-contact-manager.herokuapp.com/)

 * The server set up on heroku pulls from the main branch of the repo and auto-deploys for us.

# Accounts
  * Please follow Nyasha's guide to account setup [here](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/blob/master/misc/blasts/cloud9-setup.md)

# Flow
  * The flow of the app right now is pretty straightforward and laid out somewhat [here](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/blob/master/misc/blasts/init_tasking.md)


# Tasking
  * There are about 8-9 high priority tasks.
  * If you look [here](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/projects/1), it's the first group of tasks before "create search mechanism"
    * These 8 cover most of the 5 UMBATs specified by Leinecker.

# Roadmap
  * ~~Feature Friday?~~ Sunday Fun(ctional day)
    * By the end of this week/weekend, I'd like to have something functional for the contact Manager. (See 5 UMBATs)

    * Next week, I'd like to see if we can get UI updates and authentication.

    * The final week will be used for tying up loose ends in terms of remaining requirements, the PPT, etc.
