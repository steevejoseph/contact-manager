All,

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YzZeIwMHl7JuFa3xFdvCwnjJN1QhRs5N) is the link to the zip of videos I was talking about earlier (~4.8 G).


Also, [here](https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/webdevbootcamp) is a link to a (read only) copy of Colt's Cloud9 workspace.

Just wanted to give a solid reference/resource for [groking](http://ninjawords.com/grok) some of the tech we're using.

The following are some sections that are important to key in on. The links are to notes that I took for those sections, but the .ipynb extension only renders on Desktop view:

* 08 - 14: [Javascript fundamentals](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/JavaScript/notes)

* 20: [Backend, some context](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Backend)

* 22: [Node fundamentals](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Backend)

* 23 - 24: [Express fundamentals](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Backend)

* 25: [Using APIs](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/APIs/notes)

* 27: [Using Mongoose to build Schemas, Models, and Objects](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Databases/notes)

* 29: [RESTful routes](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Databases/notes)
* 30: [Associations](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Databases/notes)
* 32: [Authentication](https://github.com/steevejoseph/contact-manager/tree/master/misc/notes/Authentication)

There's also 37 for a gentle intro to git, and 38 for a gentle intro to deployment with Heroku.

Moving forward, I'd like to start breaking down some of the requirements into actual tasking, and then start prioritizing+assigning tasks.

As always, any questions/comments/concerns/feedback/etc are welcome. I'm trying to balance making this as stress-free as possible for y'all, giving everyone an opportunity to learn and get some experience with actual industry tools (for the res, ofc :smirk:), and making something you'd be proud to show off.

I anticipate some growing pains along the way, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Thank you all, have a great weekend.

Kind regards,<br>
Steeve
